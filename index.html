        <h2>CSS Custom Scroll</h2>
        <p>Custom scrollbars are getting more popular nowadays, and I’m very keen to dig into them. There are different
            reasons why to customize a scrollbar. For example, the default scrollbar can make an app UI look
            inconsistent across multiple operating systems, and here we can get the benefit of having a unified style.
        </p>
        <p>I have always been interested in learning about how to customize a scrollbar in CSS but didn’t get the chance
            to do so. In this article, I will take the opportunity and learn about them and document this journey.</p>

        </div>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>The first thing that I want to explain is the components or the parts of a scrollbar. A scrollbar contains
            the track and the thumb. Here is a visual that shows them:</p>
        <div class="scroll-img">
            <img src="./scrollbar-parts-2.jpg" alt="scroll-parts" />
        </div>
        <p>There is one important thing to keep in mind that a scrollbar can work horizontally or vertically, depending
            on the design.</p>
